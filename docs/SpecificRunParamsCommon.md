**run_as_gid** | **int** | The group id to run the entrypoint of the container which executes the workspace. Default to the value specified in the environment asset &#x60;runAsGid&#x60; field (optional). Use only when the source uid/gid of the environment asset is not &#x60;fromTheImage&#x60;, and &#x60;overrideUidGidInWorkspace&#x60; is enabled. | [optional] 
**supplemental_groups** | **str** | Comma separated list of groups that the user running the container belongs to, in addition to the group indicated by runAsGid.

Using an empty string implies reverting the supplementary groups of the image. | [optional] 
**environment_variables** | [**EnvironmentVariables**](EnvironmentVariables.md) |  | [optional] 
**node_type** | **str** | Nodes (machines), or a group of nodes on which the workload will run. To use this feature, your Administrator will need to label nodes.

For more information, see [Projects](https://docs.run.ai/admin/admin-ui-setup/project-setup). | [optional] 
**node_pools** | **list[str]** | A prioritized list of node pools for the scheduler to run the workspace on. The scheduler will always try to use the first node pool before moving to the next one if the first is not available. | [optional]
